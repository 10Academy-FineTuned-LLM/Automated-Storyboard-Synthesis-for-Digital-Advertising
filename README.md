# Automated-Storyboard-Synthesis-for-Digital-Advertising

## Overview

Recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, particularly with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have revolutionized capabilities in the digital domain. These technologies facilitate the intricate processing of data, bridging textual concepts and visual storytelling. Integration of these advancements simplifies translating complex ideas into visuals, enhancing creativity and efficiency in content generation. The objective is to leverage these capabilities to transform textual descriptions of advertisement concepts into detailed storyboards, making digital campaign conceptualization more intuitive and impactful.

Adludio, a leader in online mobile advertising, specializes in creating engaging ads with dynamic content like mini-games, videos, texts, and images. They provide services such as collecting comprehensive briefs, designing interactive ads, distributing creatives through real-time bidding, and optimizing the process with machine learning algorithms. In response to the transformative era of advertising, Adludio is initiating an ambitious project to automate the end-to-end advertising production process. This automation, utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, aims to expedite ideation and execution, presenting clients with creative options rapidly and reducing the traditional turnaround time from over a week to mere days. Your task is to architect and develop a cutting-edge machine learning solution that automates the conversion of textual advertisement concepts into visually compelling storyboards, intelligently interpreting concepts, generating relevant assets, and synthesizing cohesive storyboards for proposed ad campaigns.

## Expected outcome

Creating an automated pipeline that can generate an asset given a concept and then compose those assets into landing and ending frames. Finally, creating a storyboard that can be used to create an ad campaign.
